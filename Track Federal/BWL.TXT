Description             : UAC certainly didn't plan for you to see this.
                          Strange monuments, some kind of electrified liquid,
                          chairs with head devices... what was even going on
                          here?
                          The map takes some visual moments from E2M4 and The
                          Inmost Dens. There's a lot of damaging liquid on
                          the map, but there are just as many first aid kits,
                          so don't grab a first aid kit unnecessarily.
