Description             : Speedmap event hosted by the local Ru community. 
                          
                          The conditions of the event were as free and simple
                          as possible - the only limitation that participants
                          had was time. The idea of the event was that
                          someone just started to do something and most
                          importantly immediately bring it to completion
                          (partially analogous to NaNoWADMo).
                          
                          A quick summary of the rules:
                          - The participant chooses his own time for which he
                            should make a map, but no more than 10 hours.
                          - The participant is free to make a map in any
                            format, for any target ports and for any game on
                            the Doom engine.
                          - The map is the priority, not the timer!
                            Generating ideas, selecting music, textures, and
                            other resources are not counted in the timer. Only
                            the mapping process itself counts. Similarly, fixes
                            and balance adjustments are allowed after the map
                            has been made (but only small ones).
                          - Authors are free to do whatever they want with
                            their maps afterwards, to refine them, to remake
                            them, to release them separately. Their work is not
                            rigidly tied to the project, in this package stored
                            just speedmaps, which later in the hands of their
                            authors may well serve as a foundation for
                            something more ambitious.
